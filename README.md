# Take home task for AS24

## How to Run Locally
* go the the root of the project (where this readme is)
* run this command `cd client && yarn && yarn build && cd ../server && yarn && yarn start`
* visit `http://localhost:3001` in a browser
* upload csv files to see data

### Notes
* I was only able to implement the first 2 aggregations, did not have time for the other 2
* This seemed more of a backend task, so as the testing description noted, I did not apply many frontend styles at all
